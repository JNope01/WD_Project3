                <h1>Survival Tips&Trainings</h1>
                <p>12 tips for surviving a zombie apocalypse</p>
                <ol class="tips-list">
                    <li><strong>Separate friends from foes:</strong> You can’t survive an apocalypse alone. Build a
                        small,
                        close-knit team of allies.</li>

                    <li><strong>Set up a base:</strong> Find a safe place before dark where you can plan and sleep
                        without
                        fear
                        of zombie interruption.</li>

                    <li><strong>Make hunting for supplies a priority:</strong> Prioritize finding food, first aid kits,
                        lighters, sleeping bags, and more.</li>

                    <li><strong>Don’t drink the water:</strong> Bottled water is crucial. An infectious virus may be in
                        the
                        water. Hand sanitizer is also essential.</li>

                    <li><strong>Pull your weight:</strong> Make yourself indispensable to your survival group to avoid
                        being
                        abandoned.</li>

                    <li><strong>Eliminate the weakest link:</strong> If a team member is a liability, it's acceptable to
                        abandon
                        them to their fate.</li>

                    <li><strong>Find the perfect zombie-fighting ensemble:</strong> Protective clothing is essential to
                        avoid
                        blood splatter. Goggles, gloves, and a helmet are recommended.</li>

                    <li><strong>Just because you have shelter doesn’t mean you’re safe:</strong> Zombies can break
                        through
                        barriers, especially in large numbers.</li>

                    <li><strong>Never turn your back on a zombie:</strong> Zombies can move quickly, especially at
                        night.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Find ways to fight boredom:</strong> Create your own entertainment, and personal dramas
                        can
                        be a
                        source of distraction.</li>

                    <li><strong>Be ready for anything:</strong> Prepare physically and psychologically for the unknown
                        nature of
                        a zombie apocalypse.</li>

                    <li><strong>Beware of humans:</strong> In an apocalypse, friends can become foes quickly. Trust no
                        one
                        blindly.</li>
                </ol>
